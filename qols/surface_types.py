"""Surface type enumeration for qOLS.

Centralises the string constants used to identify ICAO Annex 14 obstacle
limitation surfaces.  Using this Enum instead of bare string literals ensures:
- Typos are caught at import time by the Enum constructor or IDEs.
- A single place to update if a tab label ever changes in the .ui file.
- Type-checker support for exhaustive ``match``/``if`` chains.

Because ``SurfaceType`` inherits from ``str`` as well as ``Enum``, every member
**is** a plain string and compares equal to its corresponding tab label:

    >>> SurfaceType.APPROACH == "Approach Surface"
    True
